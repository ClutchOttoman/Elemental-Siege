# Known Bugs:

- Towers may be placed at the wrong elevation on some tiles, or may be placeable on tiles where they should not be.

- Tidal Towers at the top of ramps are extremely powerful.

- All air towers are very strong in comparison to the other towers. 

- Stunning enough enemies to bottleneck the entire wave (if it's a large wave) is very bad for performance.

- Sometimes, some enemies lose their navigation abilities and revert to being physics objects. This soft-locks the player for several minutes until the enemy unloads after its lifespan runs out. This happens frequently on level 5.

- The final waves of the last few levels may cause lag due to the large number of enemies.

- The flamethrower tower does not do damage to enemies.

- Air enemies instantly die on spawn after wave 4 or 5, depending on the level

- Sometimes exiting out of tower placement mode doesnâ€™t work.
